Markdown is the simplest way to write clean academic posts. It keeps the source readable while Jekyll turns it into a polished page.

## Headings

```markdown
## Main Section

### Smaller Section
```

Use `##` for main sections inside a post. The page title already comes from the front matter.

## Paragraphs And Emphasis

```markdown
This is a paragraph.

This sentence has **bold text** and *italic text*.
```

Rendered result:

This sentence has **bold text** and *italic text*.

## Lists

```markdown
- Define the physical system.
- Write the governing equation.
- Interpret the result.
```

Rendered result:

- Define the physical system.
- Write the governing equation.
- Interpret the result.

## Links

```markdown
[Visit the research page]({{ '/research/' | relative_url }})
```

Rendered result:

[Visit the research page]({{ '/research/' | relative_url }})

## Tables

```markdown
| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $E$ | Energy |
| $\psi$ | Wavefunction |
```

Rendered result:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $E$ | Energy |
| $\psi$ | Wavefunction |

## Code Blocks

Use fenced code blocks for commands, programs, or source examples:

````markdown
```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```
````

## Recommended Post Structure

Start with a short introduction, then use clear section headings. Keep equations near the text that explains them. End with a small note, example, or checklist the reader can use immediately.
